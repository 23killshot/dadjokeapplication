Features of Gin for development

Speed: Gin is built for speed. The framework offers a Radix tree based routing and small memory footprint. No reflection. Predictable API performance.

Crash-Free: Gin has the capability of catching crashes or panics during runtime, and can recover from them. This way your application will always be available.

Routing: Gin provides a routing interface to allow you to express how your web application or API routes should look.
JSON Validation: Gin can parse and validate JSON requests easily, checking for the existence of required values.

Error Management: Gin provides a convenient way to collect all the errors occurred during a HTTP request. Eventually, a middleware can write them to a log file or to a database and send them through the network.

Built-In Rendering: Gin provides an easy to use API for JSON, XML, and HTML rendering.
